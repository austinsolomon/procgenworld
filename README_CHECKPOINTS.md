Large model files and environment bundles are not committed to Git.
They were moved to: ~/model_store/procgenworld/<same-subpath>
To run locally, either:
1) copy them back into the same paths under this repo, or
2) re-download using the official scripts (e.g., Matrix-3D code/download_checkpoints.py).
